  "description": "The image depicts a Hindu god and goddess, likely Shiva and Parvati, sitting together on a pedestal. They are both adorned with elaborate golden jewelry, including necklaces, bracelets, and ornate crowns. The god, who is seated on the left, has fair skin and is holding a golden pot in his left hand. His right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or assurance, with a symbol marked on his palm. He wears a pink cloth draped over his leg. The goddess is seated on the god's left leg, with a red garment draped over her legs and a green blouse. In her right hand, she holds a golden trident with a dumbbell-shaped object attached. The background is a mottled blue color, with a white halo effect behind the figures. The pedestal they are seated on is golden and has an intricately carved design. The overall style of the image is traditional Hindu art, with a focus on detail and symbolism.",

      "who is the god and  goddess  is he form of bhairava ?",
      "Based on the image, the god is Shiva and the goddess is Parvati. Bhairava is a fierce manifestation of Shiva, so Shiva is a form of Bhairava."

      "but i think he is swarnakarshana bhairava think again",
      "Based on the image, it is difficult to definitively say if the figure is Swarnakarshana Bhairava. The imagery is consistent with Shiva and Parvati. Swarnakarshana Bhairava is typically depicted holding a pot of gold, which could potentially be what is being held. However, without more distinct characteristics of Swarnakarshana Bhairava, it's more likely Shiva and Parvati.\n"
